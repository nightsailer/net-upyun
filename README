SYNOPSIS
        # Yes, I love modern perl!
        use v5.12;
        use Net::UpYun;
    
        my $upyun = Net::UpYun->new(
            bucket_account => 'xxxxx',
            bucket_password => 'xxxx',
            bucket => 'bucket_name',
            # optional
            api_domain => 'http://v0.api.upyun.com',
        );

        # get bucket/folder/file usage
        my $usage = $upyun->usage;
        # or folder/file
        say $upyun->usage('/demo');

        # switch bucket
        $upyun->use_bucket('bucket_new');
        # use different account/password
        $upyun->use_bucket('bucket_new',$new_account,$new_password);

        # create dir
        my $ok = $upyun->mkdir('/demo2');

        # list file under the directory
        my $files = $upyun->list('/demo2');

        # rm dir
        my $ok = $upyun->rmdir('/demo2');

        # upload file
        my $ok = $upyun->put($file_key,$file_bytes);

        # get file content
        my $bytes = $upyun->get($file_key);

        # delete file
        $upyun->delete($file_key);

        # change api domaim
        $upyun->api_domain('http://v1.api.upyun.com');

DESCRIPTION
    This module provides very simple interfaces to UpYun Cloud servie,for
    more details about UpYun storage/CDN clound service, see
    <http://www.upyun.com/>.

    This module uses WWW::Curl and libcurl for best performance, I just test
    on Mac Lion and Linux, maybe works on Windows/Cygwin.

TODOS
    Much jobs to do.

    *   handy client shell.

    *   copy/move file under same bucket or between different bucket.

    *   simple check file exists on remote ,no need to fetch its
        content,save bandwidth.

    *   display/compare files checksum(MD5) local and remote.

    *   streaming upload to save memory.

    *   useful utility, like tar/untar to/from upyun on fly.

    *   multi operation and performance requests in parallel.

    *   code clean and refactory.
